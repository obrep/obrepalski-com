Hi! üëã

I‚Äôm Pawe≈Ç, an experienced software engineer with a solid foundation in machine learning and research background. I specialise in designing and implementing backend ML systems, cloud infrastructure, and scalable solutions.

My journey began in aerospace research, where I worked on flight simulators and computational fluid dynamics. My bachelor's thesis on turbulence simulation was a turning point for me, as I was able to run my calculations on one of the most powerful supercomputers of the time. I immediately got hooked on programming and large-scale systems, which is what I‚Äôve been working on ever since.

Over the past few years, I‚Äôve been working on large-scale Recommendation Systems‚Äîinitially at ByteDance and currently at ShareChat. I‚Äôm leading the delivery team that handles the process of providing feed recommendations and balancing different content types.

Outside of tech, I love most types of physical activity - gym/bike/skiing/sauna. I‚Äôm also a lucky owner of amazing Shiba Inu - Gustaw üêï
