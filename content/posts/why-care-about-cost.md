Cost optimization has been one of my main focus areas for the past two years, and I’ve heard the same question come up time and again: “Why should software engineers care about this?” Sure, the obvious answers revolve around maximizing profits and being more cost-effective than the competition. But there are a few less obvious reasons that often get overlooked, and they matter more now than ever before.

# Context

In the past decade, companies got used to scaling at any cost, essentially paying people to use their platforms with the hope of capturing the market and figuring out profitability later. Big names like Uber and Airbnb are prime examples. This was driven by several factors:

Cloud computing made it possible to scale rapidly without worrying about infrastructure.
Rapid technological advancements opened up new markets.
And most significantly, the era of cheap money — thanks to near-zero interest rates (a phenomenon called Zero Interest-Rate Policy, or ZIRP).

With low interest rates, traditional low-risk investments (like bonds) were less attractive, pushing more money into startups. This led to massive hiring sprees, especially during the pandemic, as everyone aimed to be the next big thing.

But things have changed. While some parts of the industry (like certain LLM startups) still operate with this "growth at all costs" mentality, it’s no longer the default. So what happened, and why should software engineers care?

# What Can You Do to Stand Out?

Engineers who can build cost-efficient systems are becoming more valuable, as the industry shifts towards sustainable growth. Here’s how you can set yourself apart:

- **Become a Product-Oriented Engineer**:
    Learn more about the business side of things. Understanding why your company is successful helps you make better technical decisions.
    Get comfortable with “doing more with less.” Resource constraints can be an opportunity to innovate and find simpler solutions.
    Prefer simpler solutions. “Good enough” systems are usually cheaper to maintain and operate, freeing up your time for more impactful work.

- **Master Cost-Efficient System Design**:
    Cost-efficient systems are often simpler and easier to maintain (as long as you don’t go to extremes trying to squeeze out every penny).
    This reduces the time your team spends on maintenance and on-call, freeing up bandwidth for new projects.

- **Invest in Cross-Disciplinary Skills**:
    Being able to create scalable, cost-efficient systems requires a unique skill set at the intersection of software engineering, DevOps, and business understanding.
    There aren’t many engineers who can effectively balance cost and product trade-offs, so mastering this can be a major career accelerator.

This article series will dive deeper into these aspects, starting with actionable steps to optimize your cloud services.
